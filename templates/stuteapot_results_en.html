            <h2>What is the meaning-oriented learning style?</h2>
            <p>
              According to Vermunt, when learning is oriented towards the
              creation of meaning, knowledge is processed by relating the
              details to the subject matter as a whole and structuring it. The
              knowledge content is processed critically. It is often paired with
              an awareness and a capacity of evaluating how you learn and what
              you learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning is associated to the mental model of constructing
              knowledge. Moreover, a meaning-oriented learning style is
              motivated by personal interest in the subject matters.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="result-explanation-RO">
            <h2>What is the reproduction-oriented learning style?</h2>
            <p>
              The reproduction-oriented learning style favours an analytical,
              organised approach to studying. Knowledge is processed by
              memorising and rehearsing, and by analysing theories or problems
              step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because learning is thought as an intake of knowledge, studying
              means making sure the knowledge has been received. This often
              leads to a need of external regulation, for instance verifying if
              a concept is understood or if a set of items is memorized entirely
              by completing a mock-exam or practicing on an exercise sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning is motivated by either obtaining a certificate, a grade
              or a degree (depending on the scale) or testing one-self, hence
              thinking of academic pursuit as a challenge.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="result-explanation-AO">
            <h2>What is the application-oriented learning style?</h2>
            <p>
              The application-oriented learning style is maybe the most forward
              one as it is characterised by a need for concretising knowledge
              and sense the use one can make of it. Studying is learning how to
              use knowledge, how to apply it to concrete situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is often paired with a motivation that comes from something
              concrete still – obtaining a certificate – or that comes from a
              rather precise idea of why learning is needed which can be a
              vocation for a future job.
            </p>

          <br />
          <div class="result-explanation-U">
            <h2>What is the undirected learning style?</h2>
            <p>
              When learning is undirected, the lack of a clear motivation makes
              it difficult to be aware one’s own learning processes, goals and
              overall relation to knowledge. There is often a lack of
              regulation, that’s to say a lack of perspective and of concrete
              actions to evaluate one’s knowledge and learning methods or
              strategies
            </p>
            <p>
              It is often associated with an ambivalent learning orientation,
              and somehow a difficulty to understand the point of studies.
              Learning may be thought simply as a stimulating activity. It may
              also be viewed a as cooperation, but where others take the lead or
              even that leads to nowhere precisely.
